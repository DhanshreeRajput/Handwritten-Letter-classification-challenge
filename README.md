# Handwritten-Letter-classification-challenge

Deep Learning Project - 1:

Handwritten Letter Classification Challenge:

Train a deep learning model to classify any 10 letters from one of the Indian languages. The project involves the following steps;

1. Collect images of handwritten letters of one of the Indian languages 
2. Split the data into train and test tests (80% train and 20% test)
3. Train a classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks using your own architecture on the training data
4. Validate the model on the test data 
5. Fine tune the parameters to increase the classification accuracies of the model on training and test data.
